==Typographer {<img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/brain-geek/typographer.png" />}[http://travis-ci.org/brain-geek/typographer]


Simple plugin to make text more readable by applying some typographic rules to string. It is intended to use for russian texts, but some english typography rules are also supported.

==Example

You can use <tt>ty</tt> helper in your views:

	ty 'This is a page title'
	# => 'This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;page title'

You can define custom formats for typography rules:

  TypographerHelper.register(:article, [TypographerHelper::Parsers::SimpleFormat, TypographerHelper::Parsers::Basic])

And use it:

	ty 'This is article text with custom typography', :article

Plugin also replaces h and simple_format helpers to apply typography to their results.

==Installation

In your <tt>Gemfile</tt> add

	gem 'typographer'

and run <tt>bundle install</tt>.
